That's the power of multi-agent systems (MAS), and for software developers, understanding and implementing them opens up a world of enhanced capabilities and efficient problem-solving.\n\n### **Main Sections:**\n\n**1. Enhanced Modularity and Reusability: Building Smarter, Not Harder**\n    *   **Decomposition into Independent Units:** MAS allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable, and self-contained agents, each responsible for a specific function.\n    *   **Plug-and-Play Components:** This inherent modularity makes agents highly reusable across different projects, significantly reducing development time and effort.\n\n**2. Robustness and Resilience: When One Fails, Others Carry On**\n    *   **Fault Tolerance through Redundancy:** If one agent encounters an error or fails, the system can often continue operating by reassigning tasks or utilizing other available agents.\n    *   **Graceful Degradation:** Instead of a complete system crash, MAS can often degrade performance gracefully, maintaining core functionality even under adverse conditions.\n\n**3. Scalability and Flexibility: Growing with Your Needs**\n    *   **Easy System Expansion:** Adding new capabilities or handling increased workloads becomes as simple as introducing new agents or replicating existing ones.\n    *   **Adaptable to Changing Environments:** Agents can be designed to sense and react to their environment, allowing the system to adapt dynamically to evolving requirements or external stimuli.\n\n**4.

The foghorn moaned its mournful song, a familiar lullaby to his solitary life. Tonight, however, felt different. A flicker, not of his lamp, but something *else*, caught his eye near the rocky shore. It was a rolled parchment, impossibly bright, bobbing in the phosphorescent sea. He reeled it in with a gaff. Unfurled, it revealed a map, lines of pure, pulsing light tracing a course across an unknown ocean. Strange symbols pulsed within the glow, hinting at treasures or terrors beyond his wildest dreams. The light pulsed, as if beckoning him.\nCriticAgent > This story sets a strong mood and introduces an intriguing mystery. Here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n*   **Character Depth for Silas:** While Silas is established as a solitary lighthouse keeper, adding a brief glimpse into his past or his internal desires could make his reaction to the map more compelling. For instance, does he yearn for adventure, or is he content with his quiet life? This would inform how he interprets the map's beckoning.\n*   **Elaborate on the Map's Mystery:** The \"strange symbols\" are a good hook, but further description could enhance the sense of wonder or dread. Are they ancient runes, alien script, or something else entirely? Hinting at their nature, even subtly, could deepen the enigma.\n*   **Foreshadowing the Choice:** The pulsing light \"beckoning him\" is a powerful closing image. To strengthen the narrative arc, consider adding a subtle element earlier that hints at a potential choice or change Silas might face. This could be a fleeting thought about his routine, a memory of a past regret, or even a peculiar interaction with a passing ship.\nRefinerAgent > Old Silas, keeper of the Serpent's Tooth light, polished the colossal Fresnel lens until it gleamed, his weathered hands moving with a practiced rhythm that echoed the monotonous beat of his solitary life. The foghorn moaned its mournful song, a familiar lullaby that had long since replaced any yearning for a life beyond these isolated rocks. Yet, tonight, a disquiet settled in his bones, a feeling as foreign as the strange luminescence he now saw dancing on the waves. Decades of routine had not dulled his sharp eyes; a flicker, not of his lamp, but something *other*, pulsed near the shore. It was a rolled parchment, impossibly bright, bobbing in the phosphorescent sea. With a practiced cast of his gaff, he reeled it in.\n\nUnfurled, the parchment was no ordinary find. Lines of pure, pulsing light traced a course across an unknown ocean, the light itself seeming to hum with an otherworldly energy. Strange symbols, like fractured constellations or the forgotten script of a drowned civilization, pulsed within the glow, hinting at both unimaginable treasures and unspeakable terrors. Silas traced a line with a trembling finger, a shiver running down his spine. He’d always found solace in the predictable solitude, a quiet penance for a life of reckless youth and a lost love he rarely allowed himself to remember. But the map thrummed, a silent siren call, stirring a long-dormant ember of adventure, or perhaps, of a profound mistake. The light pulsed, not just beckoning, but *demanding* a choice, a departure from the only life he had ever known.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
