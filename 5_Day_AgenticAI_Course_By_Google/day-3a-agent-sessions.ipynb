AI-Powered Drug Discovery is Exploding:**\n\n*   **Accelerated Target Identification:** AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of biological data (genomics, proteomics, clinical data, scientific literature) to identify novel disease targets (specific genes, proteins, or pathways) that were previously unknown or difficult to find.\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is a game-changer. Instead of just screening existing libraries, AI can now *design* novel drug molecules from scratch, optimizing them for specific properties like binding affinity, efficacy, and reduced toxicity. Generative AI models are particularly powerful here.\n*   **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:** Machine learning models can predict how a potential drug candidate will perform *in silico* (on a computer) before costly lab experiments, saving time and resources. This includes predicting side effects and potential drug-drug interactions.\n*   **Optimizing Preclinical Studies:** AI can help select the most promising drug candidates for further testing, design more efficient preclinical experiments, and even predict the outcomes of these studies.\n*   **Repurposing Existing Drugs:** AI can sift through data to find new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, which is a much faster and cheaper route to market than developing entirely new compounds.\n\n**Examples of AI in Drug Discovery:**\n\n*   **Companies like Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Atomwise, and BenevolentAI** are at the forefront, using AI to discover novel drug candidates for various diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n*   **Recent breakthroughs:** Several AI-discovered drugs are now entering or have entered clinical trials, demonstrating the tangible progress being made.\n\n**2. Advances in Synthetic Biology and Gene Editing:**\n\n*   **CRISPR-based Therapeutics:** While not strictly drug discovery, CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies are creating entirely new therapeutic modalities. AI is playing a role in designing more precise and efficient gene-editing tools.\n*   **Engineered Cells and Microbes:** Synthetic biology is being used to engineer cells or microbes to produce therapeutic molecules or even act as living drugs.\n\n**3. New Modalities Beyond Small Molecules and Antibodies:**\n\n*   **RNA-based Therapeutics:** mRNA vaccines (like those for COVID-19) have opened the door for other RNA-based therapies for a range of diseases, from cancer to genetic disorders.\n*   **Peptide Therapeutics:** Short chains of amino acids (peptides) are emerging as potent and specific therapeutic agents with improved safety profiles compared to some small molecules.\n*   **Oligonucleotide Therapeutics:** These are short, synthetic strands of DNA or RNA that can modulate gene expression, offering new ways to treat genetic diseases.\n\n**4. Enhanced High-Throughput Screening and Automation:**\n\n*   **Robotic automation:** Advanced robotics allows for the screening of millions of compounds much faster and more efficiently.\n*   **Organ-on-a-chip and 3D tissue models:** These sophisticated lab-grown models of human organs and tissues provide more accurate predictions of drug responses than traditional cell cultures, reducing the need for animal testing and improving the translation of preclinical results to humans.\n\n**5. Focus on Undruggable Targets:**\n\n*   Traditional drug discovery has struggled to target certain disease-causing proteins (e.g., those lacking well-defined binding pockets). New AI-driven approaches and novel chemical modalities are beginning to make these \"undruggable\" targets accessible.\n\n**Challenges and the Future:**\n\nDespite these incredible advances, challenges remain:\n\n*   **Validation:** AI-predicted drug candidates still need rigorous experimental validation.\n*   **Data Quality and Access:** The success of AI depends on high-quality, comprehensive, and accessible biological and chemical data.\n*   **Regulatory Hurdles:** Approving novel AI-discovered drugs requires careful scrutiny and established pathways.\n*   **Cost:** While AI can reduce some costs, the overall drug discovery and development process remains incredibly expensive.\n\nHowever, the trajectory is clear: **AI and these other technological leaps are fundamentally transforming drug discovery, making it faster, more efficient, and more likely to yield novel and effective treatments for a wider range of diseases.** We are likely to see an increasing number of drugs entering clinical trials and ultimately reaching patients that owe their existence to these new approaches.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **Advances in Synthetic Biology and Gene Editing**. This is a fascinating and rapidly growing area with profound implications for medicine.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n**What are Synthetic Biology and Gene Editing?**\n\n*   **Synthetic Biology:** This field involves the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, or the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes. Think of it like engineering biological components with the same precision we use to build electronics. This can involve modifying existing organisms or creating entirely new ones with specific functions.\n*   **Gene Editing:** This refers to technologies that allow scientists to make precise changes to the DNA of living organisms. The most famous example is **CRISPR-Cas9**, which acts like molecular scissors to cut DNA at specific locations, allowing for genes to be removed, added, or altered.\n\n**How are they impacting Drug Discovery and Therapeutics?**\n\nThe impact is multifaceted, moving beyond traditional \"drug\" molecules to entirely new ways of treating diseases:\n\n1.  **CRISPR-Based Therapeutics:**\n    *   **Correcting Genetic Defects:** The most direct application is to fix faulty genes that cause genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, and certain forms of blindness. For example, scientists are using CRISPR to edit the genes responsible for these conditions *in vivo* (directly in the body) or *ex vivo* (editing cells outside the body and then reintroducing them).\n    *   **Developing Cancer Immunotherapies:** CRISPR is being used to engineer a patient's own immune cells (like T-cells) to better recognize and attack cancer cells. This involves modifying genes to enhance their anti-cancer activity or remove \"brakes\" that prevent them from attacking.\n    *   **Creating Disease Models:** CRISPR is invaluable for creating precise animal or cell models of human diseases, which are essential for understanding disease mechanisms and testing potential new drugs and therapies.\n\n2.  **Engineered Cells as Therapies (Cell Therapies):**\n    *   **CAR T-cell Therapy:** This is a prime example. T-cells are genetically modified using techniques (often involving viral vectors or other gene editing tools) to express Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) that specifically target cancer cells. These engineered cells are then infused back into the patient to fight the cancer.\n    *   **Stem Cell Therapies:** Synthetic biology can be used to engineer stem cells for regenerative medicine, aiming to repair damaged tissues and organs.\n    *   **Microbial Therapies:** Scientists are engineering bacteria or other microbes to act as living drugs. These engineered microbes could deliver therapeutic agents to specific sites in the body, colonize tumors, or even produce therapeutic molecules.\n\n3.  **Producing Therapeutic Molecules:**\n    *   **Bio-manufacturing:** Synthetic biology is used to engineer microorganisms (like yeast or bacteria) or plant cells to efficiently produce complex therapeutic proteins, antibodies, vaccines, or even difficult-to-synthesize small molecules that would be expensive or impossible to make through traditional chemical synthesis. This can lead to more cost-effective and sustainable production of existing and new medicines.\n\n**AI's Role in This Development:**\n\nYou asked specifically about the second development, but it's crucial to see how AI is interwoven:\n\n*   **Designing CRISPR Components:** AI is helping to design more precise guide RNAs and Cas enzymes for CRISPR, improving its accuracy and reducing off-target effects.\n*   **Predicting Gene Editing Outcomes:** Machine learning can predict the efficiency and potential outcomes of gene editing in different cell types or organisms.\n*   **Engineering Biological Circuits:** Synthetic biology involves designing complex biological circuits. AI can assist in the design and optimization of these circuits.\n*   **Analyzing Large Biological Datasets:** Understanding the intricate workings of cells and genes requires analyzing massive datasets. AI is essential for making sense of this information to guide synthetic biology efforts.\n\n**Why is this Significant?**\n\n*   **Paradigm Shift:** It represents a shift from treating symptoms with chemical drugs to addressing the root cause of diseases at the genetic or cellular level.\n*   **Potentially Curative Therapies:** For many genetic and chronic diseases, these approaches offer the possibility of a one-time, curative treatment rather than lifelong management.\n*   **Novel Treatment Options:** They open up entirely new therapeutic avenues for diseases that were previously untreatable.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n*   **Delivery:** Getting gene editing tools or engineered cells to the right cells in the body safely and effectively remains a major hurdle.\n*   **Safety and Off-Target Effects:** Ensuring gene editing is precise and doesn't cause unintended mutations is critical.\n*   **Immunogenicity:** The body's immune system can sometimes attack engineered cells or delivery vehicles.\n*   **Ethical Considerations:** As with any powerful technology, there are significant ethical debates surrounding germline editing (editing genes that can be passed to future generations) and equitable access to these advanced therapies.\n\nIn essence, synthetic biology and gene editing are empowering us to become biological engineers, offering powerful new tools to combat disease by directly manipulating the building blocks of life.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in synthetic biology and gene editing is vast and dynamic, encompassing both established pharmaceutical giants and innovative biotechnology startups.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
